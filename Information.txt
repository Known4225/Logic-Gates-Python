To use:
python3 logicgates.py -f 4bitALU.txt
or
python3 logicgates.py -f Two7SegmentDisplays.txt

7 Segment Displays:
Use the two 4 bit inputs at the top to change the number displayed

4 bit ALU:
Use the two four bit inputs at the top left to operate on
Use the three bit selection bits to select an operation to output
Select:
000 - AND
001 - OR
010 - XOR
011 - SHL
100 - SHR
101 - ADD
110 - SUB
111 - NOT BOUND
It does every operation simultaneously and then uses a multiplexer to select the one to output
