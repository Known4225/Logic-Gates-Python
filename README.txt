Welcome to Logic Gates™

Create logic circuits by summoning components with keybinds and click and drag mechanics to wire and rearrange components.
This project has support for 8 types of unique components with all the infinite possibilities of functional completeness

The full list of keybinds:
1, e, p - POWER component (input/output)
2, w, n - NOT gate
3, a - AND gate
4, q, o - OR gate
5 - XOR gate
6 - NOR gate
7 - NAND gate
8 - BUFFER gate
x - delete component
click + drag - move components or screen
space + click + drag - create wire
s + click + drag - select
s + click - add component to selection
c - copy/paste selected
scroll wheel - zoom
up and down arrows - zoom
space + scroll wheel - rotate component (coarse)
sideways arrows - rotate component (fine)
space + sideways arrows - rotate selected (fine)
h - toggle sidebar

All the data for a Logic Gates™ setup is in just 5 lists, some of which store redundant information. File sizes are around 60 bytes per component.

ToDo: 
Undo/Redo commands (very difficult, might require compact encoding)
Configurable keybinds - possibly just in code
Custom gate creator
Multiplexer component
Triple (or more) input gates (currently incompatible with implementation, would require large reworks)
